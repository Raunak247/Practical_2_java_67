# YCCE Student Details (Java)

## 📌 Overview

This is a simple **Java console-based program** that demonstrates the use of **classes, objects, and instance variables**. The program stores and displays basic student details such as college name, department, student name, and academic year.

The example is designed for **beginners** to understand **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java.
